* Tasks
	[...] operator that inserts between an existing connection and its input
	[_] paramaterize more controls

* Ideas
	* for incomplete compile, show path to every non-compilable input on every node
	* filter (resonant filters...)
	* https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Atomics.html
	* ffi (jack, csound, threads etc.)
	* convert existing instruments to use the graph based (csound isntrument) compiler
	* delete unneeded orc related code, convert score code to align with (csound instrument)
	* evolve a DSL for working with these instruments
	* auto-generating open-sound-control UI with hookup
	* use my own oo / multimethod lib with the behavior I want (less complex than goops)
	* unified definition of instrument across orchestra/score
	: instead of magic numbers for tables used, and magic pN fields for params
	* make orchestra =-expr construct its own free variable list for init
	* allow expr inline in parameters of an instrument
	* score syntax for clarity of overlapping events / patterns


* Done
	[X] create tables for curves for each K param (and read from them in the instrument)
		[X] convert current instrument to (csound orchestra) implementation
		[X] mkorc and mksco files
		[X] graph function to attach curves as desired
		[X] nice syntax for defining said curves
