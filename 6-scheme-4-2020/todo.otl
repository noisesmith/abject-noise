[_] Tasks
	[_] create tables for curves for each K param (and read from them in the instrument)
		[X] convert current instrument to (csound orchestra) implementation
		[X] mkorc and mksco files
		[_] graph function to attach curves as desired
		[_] nice syntax for defining said curves

* Ideas
	* paramaterize more controls
	* filter (resonant filters...)
	* https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Atomics.html
	* ffi (jack, csound, threads etc.)
	* convert existing instruments to use the graph based (csound isntrument) compiler
	* evolve a DSL for working with these instruments
	* auto-generating open-sound-control UI with hookup
	* use my own oo lib with the behavior I want
