		[X] platerev

		[X] reverbsc

* compositional concerns:
	[X] refine an interesting set of parameters with the opcodes used relatively raw
	[_] make compositions using tables of params
	[_] make table manipulation instruments
		[_] make an instrument that allows concisely copying tables and varying
		[_] make new instruments that applies curves on the parameters in tables
			[_] apply curve, max from table, min / timing from arg
			[_] set value at index via fm chain
			[_] modulate value at index via fm chain
